I recently started my core course: data science and big data.
The first two weeks involved learning the basics of Python.
The upcoming week will be an introduction to Numpy.
I look forward to the same and will read ahead to keep up with the class.
My friend and I will work on the same tomorrow, i.e., 22 January 2024.
